# About Me

I'm a rising senior at Yale University studying Physics (Intensive) and Computer Science, with a focus on exoplanetary science. I am interested in exoplanetary dynamics and atmospheres. I’ve studied how double hot Jupiter systems can form through von Zeipel–Lidov–Kozai migration in binary star systems, and I'm working on atmospheric retrievals of directly imaged gas giants and brown dwarfs.

Beyond astrophysics research, I've designed my computer science major around computer graphics and game engines. I'm interested in coding creative projects that bridge science and storytelling.
